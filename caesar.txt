# A Soliloquy of Marc Antony

O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That i am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou are the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever livèd in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly bood!
Over thy wounds now do I prosphery
Which like dumb mouth do open their ruby lips
And beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Sahll cumber all the parts of Italy
